            <h1>The Modernist Map: How Writers Analyze London’s “Tube Map”</h1>

         <div class="bodytext">
            <p>The subway is often one of the most defining characteristics of an urban area. Few structures tie together a social region as large as a city so effectively as an underground rail system. Approximately 212 cities have a subway (Serradell), but the navigation of these systems is a task that can become highly complex. Shanghai, Beijing, London, Guangzhou, New York, Moscow, Seoul, and Tokyo all have more than 300 kilometers of track (Serradell). Moreover, they all share (except New York) a common map design invented by Harry Beck, an electrical draughtsman for the London Underground, in 1932.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Beck’s major innovation was to forsake geographic accuracy, distance, and highway routes in exchange for an easy-to-read diagram reminding one of an electrical circuit (see Figure 1). By abstracting the design, he allowed commuters to easily compute the fastest route to their destination. To do this, all one needed to know were the different lines, stops, and interchanges. Today, most subway maps have a completely blank background, except for major landmarks like rivers, capitol buildings, and parks. Most importantly, Beck brought the innovation of “form follows function” (previously in other realms of design) to cartography. The form of the map in this instance follows its primary function: routing. Beck’s map combined time and space, removing both from the conception of the viewer. By placing an equal interval between stops he effectively distorted the landscape of London into a uniform surface wherein the core’s apparent size expands while the Middlesex and Essex suburbs appear to be closer together and nearer to the center. “The urban legend of the tourist who takes the Tube from Leicester Square to Piccadilly Circus” (Vertesi 22), which is a distance that could be walked in five minutes, illustrates the lack of context the famous Tube Map provides by minimizing time and space.</p>
            <p>Because most subway maps today utilize Beck’s design, many histories, reactions, and studies have been generated seeking to uncover what made it so special. Moreover, the way these texts have broached the subject varies based on their intended audience, purpose, and lens of analysis. The approach taken by a variety of sources towards the Tube Map reflects the method by which their greater genre expresses information using a variety of rhetorical devices. The three devices shared yet interpreted differently the employment of comparisons (analogies and similes), unique approaches to contextualization, as well as tone vis-à-vis the subject. The three sources that will be the basis for this analysis include an article about the history and legacy of Beck’s Tube Map in <em>BBC Culture</em> by Johnathan Glancey, an ethnographic analysis of the impact of the Tube Map on Londoners’ view of the city by Janet Vertesi, and a critical analysis through a Marxist lens of the Tube Map’s situation in history by Janin Hadlaw. The above sources vary significantly in how they approach a common topic under the standards and purpose bequeathed upon them from the genre they were influenced by.</p>
            <p>Comparison, as a rhetorical device, is crucial in helping an audience understand the ideas advanced by the author. When a writer expresses a complex point by breaking it down into smaller steps and analogizing them to other fields in which many are familiar, they effectively restrict the barrier to understanding. Comparison and synthesis of text are methods that allow many people to become fluent in an entirely different discourse. For example, someone learning to program is likely to experiment with the comparison of the output of example code to that which the beginner has altered parameters of. Likewise, when one is introduced to the discourse of cartographic design choices, comparing the existence or impact of certain styles to ideas that are commonplace permits greater comprehension.</p>
            <p>In Johnathan Glancey’s <em>BBC Culture</em> article, he writes that Beck’s distortion of geography causes the Tube Map to look “like a cross between an electric circuit diagram and a Mondrian painting” (Glancey). Particularly of interest is the use of a Piet Mondrian painting as the point of comparison for the Tube Map. Glancey does not use this similitude to “teach” the reader about what the Tube Map is, as a British reader is likely to instantly conceptualize the iconic design, but rather he uses it to draw upon the magnitude of the shift in the cartographic paradigm brought about by Beck’s design. Moreover, a <em>BBC Culture</em> reader is likely to be familiar with art history and thereby understand the importance of Mondrian’s contributions to modernist art and gather that there is an implied significance of Beck’s design. </p>
            <p>Janet Vertesi, on the other hand, implements comparisons to help the reader classify how Beck’s design impacts the modern Londoner’s interpretation of their city. For example, Vertesi describes the Tube Map as “a graphical user interface (GUI) to the city, presenting and concealing opportunities for engagement, and making sense of the city to its users” (25). Because the world of design is vast, Vertesi argues that a map through which we commonly see a city acts similarly, both conceptually and in externalization, to a GUI, which is a more prevalently studied realm of design and thereby helpful to an audience of designers. Another substantial audience reading the paper are sociologists concerned with social response to scientific theory and change. To appeal to this audience, she compares the epistemological/sociological framework of the gestalt switch to the impacts a single map has on the identity of a city and the navigation of its inhabitants (26). The gestalt switch is a method of analysis of scientific paradigm shifts termed by Thomas Kuhn in his 1962 book <em>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em>. Kuhn argues that the way in which we view natural phenomena once altered cannot be reversed which Vertesi extends to urban identity (150). Because of the existence of a dual audience engaging with Vertesi’s text, which while scholarly, has highly separated fields, Vertesi takes it upon herself to further analyze this gestalt switch. To perform this, she rebukes the idea that the Tube Map represents the same switch indicated by the classic duck-rabbit switch (26). This reference of an iconic image where one may see a duck at first but then upon being told that it looks like a rabbit, is never able to see the duck again, is likely to be well understood by a designer audience familiar with optical illusions and the subjectivity of perspective.</p>
            <p>Janin Hadlaw and Janet Vertesi, both published their works in a scholarly journal, and therefore inherit the writing styles and formal expectations of doing so. Hadlaw however interprets Beck’s design as a signifier of Marx’s materialist history. Therefore, it is vital for her article, rhetorically situated within the historical genre, to compare the event at focus to other past phenomena that illustrate a common pattern. For instance, Hadlaw makes the argument that a gestalt switch in design was pre-empted by the relationship of production and capital to our built environment, which she exemplifies with the development of perspective within the Siena School (28). Hadlaw and Vertesi implement complex frameworks to their analyses with the gestalt switch, but because of their differences in sub-genre, what they do with these frameworks is different. Vertesi explicitly uses the gestalt switch to understand our urban identity and relationship to the city (26), while Hadlaw implies the existence of a gestalt switch as the result of unseen economic forces that expands into our understanding of the inherent elements of time and space (28). Thus, the method by which comparison is used as a rhetorical device necessarily depends on the genre. If Glancey were to discuss the gestalt switch the Tube Map brought forth in his article, it would generally detract from his overall message, as it would appear unrelated to the purpose and be needlessly complicated. This complexity is however critical in the narrative of scholarly writing, as to leave it out would imply a lack of detail or sophistication to their argument.</p>
            <p>Glancey, Vertesi, and Hadlaw also employ different methods of contextualization and backstory to Harry Beck himself based on respective genres. Glancey minimizes the conflict involved in the publication of Beck’s map for cohesiveness and concision. He explains that “when Beck first presented his 'diagram' to Underground management, they were unsure” (Glancey). While this does help contextualize the story of the Tube Map’s development, any further expansion of it would veer into a biographical territory, which is not the purpose of Glancey’s article. Moreover, every detail mentioned by Glancey is kept in paragraphs of only a few sentences. This allows for many different events and facts to be mentioned but prevents him from delving deeply into any of them. </p>
            <p>Vertesi provides the briefest contextualization to Beck’s design of all the sources discussed. She mentions Beck only in passing and even in the light description of him, specifically raising the point that this map had an “influence on subway maps worldwide” (9). This lack of detail is, however, a very deliberate choice by Vertesi. Because Vertesi seeks to analyze the impact the map has on a commuter’s conception of London, discussions of the political and bureaucratic barriers involved in the implementation of the map are not salient. By virtue of writing within an ethnographic genre, Vertesi seeks to highlight her interviews and illustrations of mental maps, rather than discuss events that have little correlation with the participants’ responses.</p>
            <p>Hadlaw provides the most in-depth contextualization of Beck and his design’s backstory. Because she is writing in a historical genre that informs her analysis of the Tube Map, it becomes crucial for Hadlaw to emphasize the events that led to the creation of Beck’s design. Moreover, Hadlaw does not just refer to the events specifically focusing on the publication of Beck’s design but rather an abridged history of the London Underground railroad (29) as well as changes in production brought about by the industrial revolution. Hadlaw begins her contextualization by identifying the historical situation of Beck’s design as being correlated with the rise of monopoly capitalism (28). She parallels this idea with the actual conflict involved in the Tube Map. Here she gives detail on Beck’s initial rejection (30), his resubmission, and the fact that he had to sign away his rights to the map (he was still given authority over design, but changes were often performed by a committee without his permission) (31). </p>
            <p>When compared to Glancey’s contextualization, it becomes obvious that while they touch upon the same events, Hadlaw, driven by her genre, writes in much greater detail than Glancey. For example, Glancey does not mention anything about the history of the London Underground itself, and as previously shown only mentions that a conflict exists but does not expound further. Hadlaw also analyzes this contextualization through a lens that is very much worker-focused and subsequently concentrated on the story of Beck. In an attempt to highlight her Marxist analysis of the situation, Hadlaw explains that Beck’s fame “is a contemporary and not a historical fact. Beck was given nominal payment for his design and artwork” (31). This detail would likewise detract from the articles by Glancey and Vertesi as they have no reason to focus on a materialistic conception of history in their respective genres.</p>
            <p>Sources will also tend to exhibit a tone based on their genre as certain genre-specific conventions manifest themselves into an approach that imparts different feelings upon the topic. Glancey, for example, places a tone of admiration and implies a sense of public idolatry toward Beck’s map. For example, Glancey cites a BBC2 poll that listed the Tube Map as the second-best instance of British design which furthers his message that the map is culturally significant and held in significant regard by many people. He also refers to a controversy resulting from the decision to remove the Thames from the Tube Map. Beck’s design is admired enough that major changes to the design are encountered by doubt and outrage over what people have come to recognize as a symbol of their identity, thereby supporting the idea that Glancey’s intended tone is one of great admiration. Glancey also uses informal and colloquial speech to emphasize ease of accessibility in his writing. This allows readers to become involved with the subject on a personal scale as the piece feels rather conversational. The use of idioms like “cry me a river” and informal contractions elevate this casual tone (Glancey). The previously mentioned BBC2 poll also illustrates Glancey’s informality, as it was not a statistically rigorous method of seeking the truth, but rather an internet poll designed to generate a list reflecting the British public’s sentiments. If Vertesi or Hadlaw were to integrate this poll into their texts, it would negatively impact their desired tones by conflicting with their scholarly nature. Moreover, Vertesi seeks to generate a similar conclusion to the BBC2 poll but uses well-accepted techniques such as ethnography to uncover information that extends beyond how British people rank the Tube Map relative to other famous British designs.</p>
            <p>Vertesi presents a tone that one would expect of more scholarly sources by providing factual information in a neutral tone. She illustrates this neutral tone by providing counterarguments to her purpose. One such occurrence of this is when she cites a cognitive psychologist that presents the theory that the “map's characteristic angles and shapes make the city more, not less, difficult to understand” (23). One would likely gather in previous sections of Vertesi’s article that she believes that Beck’s Tube Map has a strictly positive impact on urban navigation. However, she belies this point to present a tone that respects the complexities of reality. Glancey would be unlikely to cite the same counterarguments as Vertesi did as doing so would contradict the admiring tone he had created of the subject. </p>
            <p>Hadlaw’s historical and material understanding of the Tube Map leads to a tone that is generally neutral but tends towards a phenomenon common among historians viewing events through a Marxist lens. This common tone held by the materialist discourse community, a subset of the wider historical genre, attempts to show the “real truth” that is often hidden by our current institutions, which preserve power and capital. This leads to a tone that can best be described as critical of the status quo understanding of the subject. For example, Hadlaw utilizes the words of Henri Lefebvre, a French Marxist academic, to argue that the Tube Map illustrates greater trends of the centralization of capital through the reduction of the concept of space and the standardization of symbols and routines (33). Vertesi argues that this same element of design leads to an understanding of a city defined by distortion (25). Despite this, the tone of historical criticality that Hadlaw employs results in different conclusions. Hadlaw presents the idea that the Tube Map was influenced by capitalist trends thereby refuting a mythologized understanding of the map. The tone that results from this is an implied criticality that retains scholarly impartiality while advancing Marxist concepts.</p>
            <p>The concept of the gestalt switch was mentioned before to illustrate how texts of different genres vary in their analyses of the same topic. The concept of a gestalt switch would, however, be an inappropriate way to analyze our conception of genres as a whole. Unlike a gestalt switch, characterized by an irreversible change in our viewpoint towards a phenomenon (Kuhn 150), genres allow us to transcend the paradigmatic framework that would constrain our understanding of some topic. As the story of the history and design of the London Underground’s Tube Map highlights, our understanding of the topic can be shifted by the text that we read about it with. Moreover, we can fluidly transfer between genres and reframe our thoughts with relative ease without causing the complete and utter confusion, that would be implied by the gestalt switch. This property of genre makes it intensely powerful, but the ability to harness it as a writer requires the implementation of conscious rhetorical devices that both explicitly and implicitly tell the reader how to interpret the words laid before them.</p>
